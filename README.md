# Calendar Task Manager

## Description

Calendar Task Manager is a simple and intuitive application that allows you to create, edit, and delete tasks for each day. Tasks are saved in the local storage, ensuring they persist even after you close the browser. If a day has too many tasks to fit within its cell, some tasks will be hidden and a "view more" button will appear. This feature is dynamic, adjusting based on the cell's height and the number of tasks.

## Features

- **Create Tasks**: Add new tasks for any day.
- **Edit Tasks**: Modify existing tasks.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks that are no longer needed.
- **Local Storage**: Tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, ensuring they persist between sessions.
- **Dynamic Task Display**: If a day has more tasks than can be displayed in its cell, a "view more" button will appear, allowing you to see all tasks for that day.
